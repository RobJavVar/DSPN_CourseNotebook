# Discussion questions

1. The lecture discussed tools to more easily navigate the scientific publishing space, but what could change systemically or ideologically to better facilitate clear and effective dissemination of scientific information?

2. Open science practices are proposed as panacea for problems in reproducibility. Provide an example of how open science practices (as proposed by Sandve et al. 2013) could hurt one or more of the types of reproducibility.
