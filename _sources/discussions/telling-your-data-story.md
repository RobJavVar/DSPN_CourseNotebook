# Discussion questions

1. Provide at least one historical, real world example where a failure of effective communication lead to an important discovery not being recognized (or at least not get recognized in the time that it was made).

2. Central to the principles for effective data communication laid out by Mensch & Kording (2017) is the idea of a rational logic for scientific communication. Why does this logic structure facilitate communication and what are ways that it might stymie the communication of scientific results?
