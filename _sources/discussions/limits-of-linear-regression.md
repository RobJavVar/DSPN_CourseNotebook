# Discussion questions

1. Consider a categorical predictor variable with 4 levels. Explain why coding it as 3 or 4 separate dummy (binary) variables makes more interpretive sense than coding it as a single variable with 4 levels.

2. Outliers and high leverage points are often confused. Explain how they are different than each other by explaining how each impacts the model fit.
