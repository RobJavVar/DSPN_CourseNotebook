# Discussion questions

1. Find an example of a data graphic from one of your papers or a paper you have recently read. Analyze the graphic along the six competing dimensions that Cairo proposed as competing goals between complexity and intelligibility.

2. Yanai & Lercher (2020) made the case that being narrowly focused on hypotheses can result in missing meaningful patterns in your data. How do you reconcile their conclusion with the case made in the theory lectures that data analysis should be hypothesis driven?
