# Discussion questions

1. Consider the following hypothesis: “Performance on a delayed discounting task is negatively impacted by childhood poverty, but only when there is a lack of community resources or evidence of neglect at home, and this effect is influenced by the amount of funding placed in local school districts as well as the age of the primary caregiver at home.” What is the graphical form of this hypothesis?

2. Mediation and moderation models are a form of causal statistical model. What exactly does this mean? How does this impact how you both interpret the outcomes of a mediation or moderation model and how you communicate these inferences?
