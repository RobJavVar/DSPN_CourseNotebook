# Discussion questions

1. The likelihood function is a very specific form of a probability function. Provide a verbal description of the likelihood function in plain English and say how it is relevant to understanding your model fit. 

2. We have gone over three different model evaluation metrics: RSE, $r^2$, & F-test. In what contexts would each method be preferred over the others? Provide one example for all three metrics.
