# Discussion questions

1. When does data become knowledge? Suppose a model predicts behavior or neural activity with high accuracy (i.e., minimal error). 
*   Under what conditions would you feel comfortable saying it has produced knowledge rather than just prediction?
*   Is high accuracy enough, or do we need causal understanding?
*   How does this distinction matter for scientific claims vs. practical applications?

2. What gets lost when we turn experience into variables? Most data science requires converting rich phenomena into variables.
*   What kinds of information are preserved by this move?
*   What kinds of information might be lost or distorted?
*   How do these losses matter for interpretation and theory-building?
